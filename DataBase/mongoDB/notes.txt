"mongod" is the primary daemon process for the MongoDB system.
It handles data requests, manages data access, and performs background management operations. 
{
    --> monogb server should be stoped
}

to run mongod ( err in mac )
--> mongod --dbpath ./mongo-data 

-------------------------------------------------


to check background server running

--> brew services list

-------------------------------------------------


-> to start mongodb
* brew services restart mongodb-community

-------------------------------------------------

-> to stop mongodb
* brew services stop mongodb-community

-------------------------------------------------

* after starting the server : 

--> mongo

* to check the directory that we created :

--> show dbs

* to change the directory :

--> use learning_mongodb

  <---- class notes ---->

  what is DATABASE 
  * we store data
  * we acces data
  * we modify data
  * we maintain data

  Types of DATABASE
  * SQL      -> structuce Query language
  * No SQL


 -->  SQL | structuce Query language
  * its a table & it contens ROW/COLUMN -> each row called as RECORD
  show data in form of table, ex: SQL



  \\ MySQL run on SQL


  --> NO SQL | NO structuce Query language

    there is a company which runs on ADS. they where not able to manage because of large data
    they cameUp with a software mongoDB.

    step for DB 
    * we have to create a dataBase
    * we create a table
    * we insert data in table


        ****
    ->  mongoDB doesnt uses table it uses document to store data 
    ->  inplace of table we have collection in mongoDB

     step for DB 
    * we have to create a dataBase
    * we create a collection
    * in thic collection we can have myData

    inplace of table we use document -> jason() ->
    {
      what is json();
      its a pair of key(property) & value

      ex -> { "x" : "y"} 
    }

  table = collection
  row/column = document

  schema -> the way want to design the document


  -> SQL  vs                                      -> NO SQL
  * based on table schema                     * based on document
  * follow a querry language                  * follow mongoose package
  * performance is not good for huge data     * mongoDB performance good with huge data
